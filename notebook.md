# jupyter-diff

This is an experiment in using version
control for Jupyter notebooks, using the
tool
[notedown](https://github.com/aaren/notedown) to automatically store
notebooks
in Markdown.

```{.python .input  n=2}
print("I ‚ù§ Jupyter!")
```

```{.json .output n=2}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "I \u2764 Jupyter!\n"
 }
]
```

## Why

Jupyter is a great tool for creating *notebooks* (`.ipynb` files). With
notebooks, one can explore new computational ideas and share narratives with
code. 

Ideas can change, and many turn to a form of version control to track
changes.

However, the underlying format
of notebooks is
JSON. It is relatively difficult to see changes to JSON objects
in classic tools
like [diff](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html).
There is still
not consensus on how to put Jupyter notebooks in version control.
See
[here][j1], 
[here][j2],
and [here](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/how-to-
version-control-jupyter),
with varied solutions like
[nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout), or
[jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext). 

Here, I will use
[notedown](https://github.com/aaren/notedown) to work with `.md` files in
Jupyter Lab, and use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

```{.python .input  n=5}
bool("Markdown") and bool("Jupyter")
```

```{.json .output n=5}
[
 {
  "data": {
   "text/plain": "True"
  },
  "execution_count": 5,
  "metadata": {},
  "output_type": "execute_result"
 }
]
```

## Setup
First, boot up Jupyter Lab.

Let's install notedown [directly from the
notebook][jakevdp]:

[jakevdp]:
https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-
jupyter/

```{.python .input  n=3}
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install numpy
```

```{.json .output n=3}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /Users/kmarwaha/miniconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages (1.15.1)\n\u001b[33mYou are using pip version 19.0.1, however version 19.1.1 is available.\nYou should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.\u001b[0m\n"
 }
]
```

<br/>

Now, we'll add the below line to your Jupyter settings:

```{.python .input  n=5}
LINE_TO_ADD = "c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'notedown.NotedownContentsManager'"
```

```{.python .input  n=8}
%store LINE_TO_ADD >> ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```

```{.json .output n=8}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "Writing 'LINE_TO_ADD' (str) to file '/Users/kmarwaha/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py'.\n"
 }
]
```

If you're following along, you can relaunch Jupyter, and create a new
Markdown
file. Once you create the file,
right-click and `Open With ->
Notebook`.

## Issues
Not everything is perfect. Here are the issues I've seen:
1. **Links
wrap, and occasionally get spaces added to them.** This is from 80-character
line limits in Markdown format. Some links will be broken because of this. One
partial solution is to reference links (see examples [here][md-cheat]).
2.
**Sometimes, Markdown cells get pasted together.** It can be easier to edit
Markdown cells in smaller chunks. To separate them, I sometimes add little code
snippets.
3. **Github doesn't render the markdown as a notebook!** Maybe if more
people use it, they can try it out. As a compromise, I converted to notebook-
output.pdf for you to read online :) This was done with `notedown notebook.md >
notebook-output.ipynb` and `jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook-output.ipynb`.

```{.python .input  n=25}
for i in range(3):
    print("~"*9 + (":-)" if i==1 else "~~~") + "~"*9)
```

```{.json .output n=25}
[
 {
  "name": "stdout",
  "output_type": "stream",
  "text": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~:-)~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n"
 }
]
```

## Sample project
Let's look at some GeoJSON data in San Francisco.
